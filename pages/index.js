          <div className="quote"><p /><i>â€œI think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. As the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows."</i>
